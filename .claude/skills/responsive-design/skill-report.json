    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What are container queries and how do they differ from media queries?",
        "answer": "Container queries apply styles based on the size of a parent container rather than the viewport. Media queries respond to the viewport width. Container queries enable truly reusable components that adapt to their container regardless of where they are placed."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does fluid typography work?",
        "answer": "Fluid typography uses CSS clamp() to create font sizes that scale smoothly between minimum and maximum values based on the viewport width. This eliminates the need for multiple breakpoint-specific font sizes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the mobile-first approach?",
        "answer": "Mobile-first means writing base styles for mobile devices first, then adding enhancements with min-width media queries for larger screens. This approach improves performance on mobile and simplifies the stylesheet structure."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I use CSS Grid vs Flexbox?",
        "answer": "Use CSS Grid for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns simultaneously). Use Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts (single row or column). Grid excels at page-level layouts; Flexbox works well for component-level alignment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are dynamic viewport units?",
        "answer": "Dynamic viewport units (dvh, svh, lvh) account for mobile browser UI that appears and disappears. Use 100dvh for full height that adjusts to show/hide browser chrome, 100svh for the smallest viewport, and 100lvh for the largest."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I test responsive designs effectively?",
        "answer": "Test on real devices when possible. Use browser DevTools device emulation for initial checks. Focus on common breakpoint ranges rather than specific devices. Test touch targets, text readability, and content overflow at each breakpoint."
